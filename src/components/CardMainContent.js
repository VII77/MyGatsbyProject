          <b>Cryptocurrencies - the future of investment</b>
        </h4>
        <p>
          The financial system is going through a major transformation.
          Cryptocurrencies are the future. It is time to get to know its
          possibilities: How do 40% (bull market) interest sound? Or 15%
          interest (bear market)? So it is possible to earn money in both bull
          and bear market? Correct.
          <p>
            Are you in a hurry and don't want to spent hours in research to
            understand the crypto world and its possibilities? Be assured you
            are at the right place at the right time. Investment in crypto
            offers lots of possibilities. But not all possibilities are great
            opportunities. Let me help you understand why some investments are
            reasonable and offer solid returns:

          <b>Decentralized finance</b>
        </h5>

        <p>
          We are used to having institutions (e.g. banks) to deal with our
          finances. We know that banks make good profits in doing so.
          Decentralized finance (defi) meanwhile offers similar opportunities as
          banks do, but it is all done with cryptocurrencies: You can lend money
          you can borrow money, you can exchange money. And it is all done
          within the software. There is no need for people to interact. The
          difference being that with defi everybody can take part in those
          operations and earn money in doing so: Basically there are two
          options:
          <p>- earn interest by lending crypto</p>
          <p>- earn interest by becoming a liquidity provider</p>
        </p>
        <p>
          Now here is the catch. There is a multitude of possibilities these
          days to get involved into defi. There is various blockchains and there
          is a multitude of cryptocurrencies. There is scams, there is hacks.
          Their are all sorts of risks. If you choose to invest without proper
          understanding you can get hurt easily. To get to know the safer
          options takes time and knowledge.

            I have done the research and earned a couple of thousand dollars so
            far in doing so. I have a system that works. What I offer is a
            hands-on guide from scratch. I will tell you which exchange is best
            (Binance) and how to move on from there in crucial detail. You will
            get to know which hardware wallet is reasonable and how to save
            money when it comes to transactions. I will tell you how to bypass
            transactions and get your profits automatically reinvested. I will
            tell you which stable coins are safe and why. You will learn how to
            be a crypto lender and a liquidity provider at the same time.
